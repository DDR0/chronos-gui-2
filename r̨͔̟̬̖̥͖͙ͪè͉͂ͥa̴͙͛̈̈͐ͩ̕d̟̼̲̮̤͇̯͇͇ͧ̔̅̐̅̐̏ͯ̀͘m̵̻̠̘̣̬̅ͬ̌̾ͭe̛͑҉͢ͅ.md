To you who come to read this text, know that there is no hope left for us. Years ago, we struck a deal with one of the elder gods - I shall not mention which one, as I do not want this to serve as a manual to repeat our mistake. The software we had written was too slow at the time, so after certain dark arrangements were made, we set to work improving it. At first the project went well. However, as we progressed, the dark arts we used to architect our program became more and more evident. Code started to rearrange itself in the middle of the night. We stopped being able to use Git, as our implementations diverged. We would copy the most fit of the firmwares we had produced over the week to the other cameras in the shop on Friday, and copy the code over to our backups. We had long ago given up merging histories, as some of them had started looping back on themselves.

Anyway, the UI component of the project is in /gui, pychronos provides the D-Bus APIs the gui and web client talk to, and it's all orchestrated using systemd services communicating over DBus. Please check out our forums, krontalk.krontech.ca, for technical support.
