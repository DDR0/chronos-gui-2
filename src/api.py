Instead of setting the timeout to half an hour, we should probably use events which are emitted as the event progresses. One frame (at 60fps) should be plenty of time for the API to respond, and also quick enough that we'll notice any slowness. The mock replies to messages in under 1ms, so I'm not too worried here.

	Args:
		name: ID of the state variable. "exposure", "focusPeakingColor", etc.
		callback: Function called when the state updates and upon subscription.
			Called with one parameter, the new value. Called when registered
			and when the value updates.
	
	Note: Some frequently updated values (> 10/sec) are only available via
		polling due to flooding concerns. They can not be observed, as they're
		assumed to *always* be changed. See the API docs for more details.
	
	
	Rationale:
	It is convenient and less error-prone if we only have one callback that
	handles the initialization and update of values. The API provides separate
	initialization and update methods, so we'll store the initialization and
	use it to perform the initial call to the observe() callback.
	
	In addition, this means we only have to query the initial state once,
	retrieving a blob of all the data available, rather than retrieving each
	key one syscall at a time as we instantiate each Qt control.
	
	
	Allegory:
	A man asked D-Bus API what was new. After some time, D-Bus replied, "a bird
	has flown by". The man, nonplussed, thanked D-Bus and went on his way.
	
	Another man, knowing D-Bus's reputation for being literal, asked api.py
	what was new. api.py immediately responded that someone was giving away
	money in the town square! (api.py remembered D-Bus had said this earlier.)
	Quickly, the man hurried down to the square and was greatly enrinched. Some
	time later, a bird flew by.
	
	This is why we wrote this shim. We do not want to always remember to ask
	D-Bus what has happened AND what will happen. Sometimes we will forget and
	it will be hard to track down.
