"""Mock for api.py. Allows easier development & testing of the QT interface.

	This mock is less "complete" than the C-based mock, as this mock only returns
	values sensible enough to develop the UI with. Currently the C-based mock is
	used for the camera API, and this mock is used for the control api. Note that
	this mock is still available for external programs to use via the dbus
	interface.

	Usage:
	import api_mock as api
	print(api.control('get_video_settings'))

	Remarks:
	The service provider component can be extracted if interaction with the HTTP
	api is desired. While there is a more complete C-based mock, in chronos-cli, it
	is exceptionally hard to add new calls to.
	
	Any comment or call in this file should be considered a proposal. It can all be
	changed if need be.
