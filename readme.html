		<h1>Chronos GUI2 Readme</h1>
		
		<p>GUI2 is a Python replacement for the C++-based camApp. The original camApp was designed as a monolith, handling the low-level register manipulation through to the high-level GUI. It was decided to break the monolithic camApp apart into two pieces â€“ an API and a GUI â€“ which have clearer responsibilities.</p>
		
		<p>This GUI, <a href="https://github.com/krontech/chronos-gui-2">which can be found on github</a>, relies on the <a href="https://github.com/krontech/chronos-api">Chronos D-Bus API</a> to run. (Although as of time of writing, this is still being split out.)</p>
		
		
		
		<h2>Project Overview</h2>
		
		<p>
			There are five major components to the Chronos project. From lowest level to highest, we have:
			<ul>
				<li>The FPGA driver, which is controlled by the camera API.</li>
				<li>The camera D-Bus API, which controls the FPGA driver and talks to the back-of-camera interface and the HTTP server over D-Bus.</li>
				<li>This, the back of camera interface, which takes input from the operator and controls the camera through the D-Bus API.</li>
				<li>The web server, which exposes an HTTP API for controlling the camera. The server uses the D-Bus API internally. (This is not implemented as of time of writing.)</li>
				<li>The web app, which takes input from the operator and controls the camera through the HTTP API. (This is not implemented as of time of writing.)</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			This project implements the back-of-camera interface. The back-of-camera interface itself has has several components:
			<ul>
				<li><a href="src/main.py"><tt>src/main.py</tt></a>: Launch point for the Python interface. (Can be run via <tt>python3 src/main.py</tt>.)</li>
				<li><a href="src/screens/"><tt>src/screens/</tt></a>: This folder holds the files implementing the various screens you visit as you navigate through the UI. Each screen usually consists of a python file providing one class which loads the corresponding .ui file. Each screen is insulated from the other screens, there are no interdependancies. The classes are used by <tt>src/main.py</tt>, which switches between them as needed.</li>
				<li><a href="src/widgets/"><tt>src/widgets/</tt></a>: Custom widgets used by chronos-gui-2. These are used to give constant, custom look and behaviour over the entire application. They're put in the .ui files in <tt>~src/screens</tt> by using QT Designer. Each widget has a <tt>*.py</tt> file and a <tt>*_plugin.py</tt> file. The <tt>*.py</tt> file contains the widget and its behaviour. The <tt>*_plugin.py</tt> file defines the widget for Designer.</li>
				<li><a href="assets/"><tt>assets/</tt></a>: External files, such as images and fonts, used by the application.</li>
				<li><a href="util/"><tt>util/</tt></a>: Miscellaneous resources. Automated deploy scripts, a template for new screens in QT Designer, an example of writing to the framebuffer. See <a href="util/readme.txt"><tt>util/readme.txt</tt></a> for details.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		
		
		<h3>Historical Context</h3>
		
		<p>Why did we decide to rewrite our firmware?</p>
		
		<p>In early 2018, our initial implementation of the Chronos 1.4 camera software was starting to cause problems. It wasâ€”quite reasonably at the timeâ€”built as a monolith using Qt 4. This got the kickstarter products out the door. As the product was refined, and more people started working on the code, long-running FPGA projects began conflicting with long-running GUI projects. Refactoring the code became quite difficult, so it was decided to split the initial camera software, the <a href="https://github.com/krontech/chronos-cam-app">camApp</a>, in to two components. One would take care of the FPGA, and one would take care of the UI. They would talk over a <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus">D-Bus API</a>.</p>
		
		<p>In the summer of 2018, it became apparent that we would be switching operating systems from Arago Linux to Debian Linux. To enable wifi on the camera, a WIFI dongle can be plugged into the USB port. However, as Arago Linux seems to have ceased development in in 2013, none of the dongles available in 2018 have supported drivers. Running Debian, driver support is much better.</p>
		
		<p>Running Debian also means we can compile modern libraries for our use, which was effectively impossible under Arago. To this end, as we were <a href="http://forum.krontech.ca/index.php?topic=135.0">planning a redesign of the user interface</a> anyway, we decided to take the opportunity to upgrade our GUI library to Qt 5 from Qt 4, and from C++ to Python. This repository contains the "vanilla" Qt 5 Python port. (A Qt Quick 5 Python port is also in the works. One will be chosen as the winner at some point, when we have more experience with both of them.)</p>
		
		
		<h3>Design Considerations</h3>
		
		<ul>
			<li>
				We have the UI .xml files available to us from the original app.
				<li>We will use those files to get us up and running.</li>
				<li>However, the custom C++ widgets are not portable.</li>
			</li>
			<li>The new UI needs to respond to updates from the web app.</li>
			<li>Performance and memory overhead budgets must be respected - the Chronos 1.4 has 1GB memory available to the CPU, which must be shared between the API, the back-of-camera interface, the web server, Debian itself, and Krontech's development tooling.</li>
		</ul>
		
		
		
		<h2>Setup and Running</h2>
		
		
		<h3>Setup</h3>
		
		<p>On your camera, or in a virtual machine, set up Python 3.6.5+ and QT 5.10+ on Debian 7. After configuring your environment to your liking and installing any missing imports required by <tt>src/cam-ui.py</tt>, you can start the UI with <tt>python3 src/cam-ui.py</tt>. If you have some trouble with this, don't worry! This is normal. It took me about 150 discreet steps and two or three weeks to get everything working properly the first time. Luckily for you (hopefully), you can find my edited notes in <a href="util/chronos debian setup instructions.txt">chronos debian setup instructions.txt</a>. Good luck. ðŸ˜¬</p>
		
		
		<h3>Running</h3>
		
		<p>Manual: Copy this repository to the camera. Then, run <tt>python3 src/cam-ui.py</tt> on the camera, from the root folder of this project.</p>
		
		<p>Automatic: The above is process is automated by the <tt>watch-*.sh</tt> scripts, in the <a href="util">util folder</a>, to automatically deploy and run the app as files change during development. (See <a href="util/readme.txt"><tt>util/readme.txt</tt></a> for more details on which file is what.) There are two options: Deploy to camera, or deploy to a testing VM. For each option, there are two scripts. One script automates copying the files to the destination, and the other script automatically reruns the application when it notices a file has been updated.</p>
		
		<p>There are two scripts because the destination side will work regardless of OS, but Mac or Windows may need to write a different upload-to-destination script. The scripts, to some extent, also deal with separate concerns.</p>
		
		<p>Assuming we're uploading files to the camera, as opposed to a VM, we'll want to run <tt>~util/watch-computer.sh</tt>. Looking in that file with our favourite text editor, we see it has three major components: a loop, <tt>find</tt> feeding into <tt>entr</tt>, and <tt>rsync</tt>. Entr is a program which watches the filesystem for change events, and runs a program when something changes. You may need to install with <tt>sudo apt install entr</tt>. In our script, entr watches the files which we seach for with <tt>find</tt>. The loop is because entr stops running if a folder is changed, so find can search for files in that folder and watch them too. The final component is the rsync invocation, which copies updated files to the camera.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Action:</strong> Rsync needs to know two things. First, where to put the changed files. By default, it uploads to <tt>cam</tt>. This preset is defined in ~/.ssh/config. You will need to add it as a preset yourself. My block looks like this:
			<code>
				#Debian, on the physical camera itself
				Host cam
				  User root
				  HostName 192.168.12.1
				  ConnectTimeout 1
			</code>
		<tt>cam</tt> is the name of the destiantion. We may need to change the HostName if the camera is not accessible via <tt>ssh root@192.168.12.1</tt>. (192.168.12.1 is the default IP address if you plug the Chronos in to your computer with MiniUSB.) You can test that your preset works by running <tt>ssh cam</tt>.</p>
		<p>Second, rsync needs to know the login credentials to the camera. To do this, rsync is set to use <tt>sshpass</tt>. (You may need to install it with <tt>sudo apt install sshpass</tt>.) <tt>sshpass</tt> references the <tt>$CHRONOS_PASSWORD</tt> environment variable, which you can set in your <tt>~/.bashrc</tt> file. (Or whatever startup file your shell is using, for example <tt>~/.zshrc</tt> for <tt>zshell</tt>.) In my .bashrc, I have the following line to do this:
			<code>
				export CHRONOS_PASSWORD="chronos" #ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ”’
			</code>
		At some point, we'll make it so you have to actually *set* your own password before SSH is enabled at all, but for now you are simply advised to disallow incoming connections from the internet at large on the network level.</p>
		
		<p>In the root of the project, on your computer, you can now run <tt>util/watch-computer.sh</tt>. This will watch for file changes and upload them to the camera.</p>
		
		<p>The second step is running the new files on the camera. First, we'll log in to the camera. There, <tt>cd gui</tt> to go to the newly-deployed project. Instead of running <tt>python3 src/cam-ui.py</tt>, we'll run <tt>util/watch-camera.sh</tt> which will run and rerun the command for us. (Under the hood, this script starts a bash loop running the python3 command. It uses <tt>watchdog</tt> (<tt>pip3 install watchdog</tt>) to restart the script when a file changes. Watchdog is configured in the inline python script near the bottom of the file.) To help debug the GUI script, an interactive prompt will be brought up in this ssh session when an error is encountered.</p>
		
		
		
		<h2>Editing</h2>
		
		<p>It is strongly encouraged to set your favourite editor up with some sort of Python linter, such as <a href="http://damnwidget.github.io/anaconda">Anaconda</a>, if it does not already support Python linting. However, <em>any</em> editor or IDE on <em>any</em> operating system may be used. This means the code may be edited using <tt>vi</tt> directly on the camera, which may be simpler than setting up your own development environment.</p>
		
		<p>The <tt>.ui</tt> files are editable with QT Designer. It needs some env vars set to pick up the custom widgets, so the easiest way to run Designer is to run <a href="util/designer.sh"><tt>util/designer.sh</tt></a>.
