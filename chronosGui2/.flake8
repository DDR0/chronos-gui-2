#E128 DDR 2018-08-08: Lines not indented enough. (Related to line breaks in a function call.)*/
#E123 DDR 2018-11-28: Error shows up in error. Bug at https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/issues/100. More fundamentally, we can't follow PEP-8 on indentation, because our function calls - being mostly QT - are often horrendously long and would bump their args off-screen if we indented to the opening bracket.*/
#E124 DDR 2018-08-08: Error shows up in error. Bug at https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/issues/103.*/
#E131 DDR 2018-00-00: Continuing lines need specific indentation.*/
#E201 DDR 2018-11-19: Whitespace after opening bracket. I demand alignment, and this stands in my way.*/
#E202 DDR 2018-00-00: Whitespace before closing bracket. [)]*/
#E221 DDR 2018-09-28: Allow extra whitespace for "table" layout programming.*/
#E222 DDR 2018-00-00: Whitespace after equality, I like tables.*/
#E226 DDR 2018-06-21: Spaces around mathematical operators is a good guideline, but a bad rule. (Keep E225 though, which just asks for *consistent* spacing around such operatiors.)*/
#E231 DDR 2018-09-06: I like grouping x y coordinates together, like fn(x,y).*/
#E241 DDR 2018-09-28: Allow extra whitespace for "table" layout programming.*/
#E251 DDR 2018-09-28: Allow extra whitespace for "table" layout programming.*/
#E261 DDR 2018-00-00: At least two spaces before inline comment.*/
#E262 DDR 2018-06-14: Inline comments should start with '#'.*/
#E265 DDR 2018-07-05: Block comments should start with '#' too. I like to use a space for textual comments, and no space for commenting out code.*/
#E272 DDR 2018-11-19: Multiple whitespace before keyword. I demand alignment, and this stands in my way.*/
#E301 DDR 2019-05-06: I don't care that there are no blank lines are before a function.*/
#E302 DDR 2018-08-08: I don't care how many blank lines are before a function.*/
#E303 DDR 2018-00-00: Too many blank lines. I like my whitespace, makes the flow of code easier to read with a good vertical cadence.*/
#E306 DDR 2018-00-00: Allow no blank lines before functions.*/
#E305 DDR 2018-00-00: Too many or too few blank lines after function definition. I prefer flexible spacing, I feel it's more readable.*/
#E309 DDR 2018-00-00: From Anaconda base settings.*/
#E401 DDR 2018-09-10: Multiple imports on one line are fine. ðŸ¤·*/
#E402 DDR 2019-02-28: Allow conditional imports followed by nonconditional imports.*/
#E702 DDR 2018-00-00: Multiple statements on one line with semicolon. [;]*/
#E711 DDR 2018-11-20: No explicit comparisons in if statements sort of breaks when switching on Null, True, and False. It is best to be explicit in that case.*/
#E712 DDR 2018-11-20: No explicit comparisons in if statements sort of breaks when switching on Null, True, and False. It is best to be explicit in that case.*/
#E731 DDR 2019-05-08: A properly used assigned lambda is sometimes the right thing.*/
#W191 DDR 2018-00-00: Spaces, not tabs. I like tabs, less prone to off-by-one errors.*/
#W291 DDR 2018-00-00: Trailing whitespace. Useful sometimes while manipulating the files, though indeed not something that should be committed.*/
#W292 DDR 2018-00-00: Trailing newline. Why is this even needed?*/
#W293 DDR 2018-00-00: Indented blank line. I like my blank lines indented, they're part of the function.*/
#W391 DDR 2018-11-01: There's no reason to put a blank line at the end of a file that I know of. It's redundant.*/
#W503 DDR 2018-00-00: I like leading boolean operators after line breaks. The operator is important, and can be hidden off-screen to the right on occasion.*/
#E117 DDR 2019-12-13: Ignore over-indent, it doesn't like the docblock comments we've made over the last few years.
#E501 DDR 2019-12-13: Ignore long lines. (Do try to keep it to 100 chars, though.)
#F403 DDR 2019-12-13: Ignore * imports, even though they break undefined name detection. We should fix this, but we don't really have time now.
#F405 DDR 2019-12-13: Ignore may be undefined warnings, due to F403 above.
#E252 DDR 2019-12-13: Let default parameters require no space around =, because I like it. Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
#W504 DDR 2019-12-13: Allow line breaks after binary operatiors. They gotta go somewhere.
