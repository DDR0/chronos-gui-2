<img src="http://forum.krontech.ca/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=138.0;attach=189;image" width="480">

The GUI2 project is a Python replacement for the C++-based camApp, for the Chronos 1.4 high-speed camera. The original camApp was designed as a monolith, handling the low-level register manipulation through to the high-level GUI.

See [docs/readme.html](https://krontech.github.io/chronos-gui-2/readme.html) for information.
