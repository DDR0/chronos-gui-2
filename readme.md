# User Interface for Chronos High-Speed Cameras

See [readme.html](readme.html) for information.

The GUI2 project is a Python replacement for the C++-based camApp, for the Chronos 1.4 high-speed camera. The original camApp was designed as a monolith, handling the low-level register manipulation through to the high-level GUI.
