Linting with MyPy
2019-09-13 - DDR

Summary: "This ain't gonna work."


Installation:
	- sudo apt install python3-mypy

Running: (in project root)
	- python3 -m mypy src/screens/about_camera.minimal.py

Notes:
	- Linting with MyPy requires Python 3.6, which means we can't annotate types quite correctly with 3.4 because it's not supported. It might be possible to post-process this, but that seems like a lot of work.
	- MyPy can't seem to figure out how to resolve any of our module imports, such as "screens.about_camera", despite being explicitly told where the folder is multiple times.
